# Linked Lists

It is a pretty simple data structure that links points in memory that contains X value.

there are some different algorithms we can use on Linked Lists:

- Singly Linked Lists
    Its when you can only go forwards when looking through data, the current node only knows the next nodes location.
    A -> B -> C -> D

- Doubly Linked Lists
    You can go both ways when looking through data:
    A <-> B <-> C <-> D

- Queue
    Basically a single linked list that is always FIFO (First in First out)

- Stack
    A singly linked list that will work the opposite of a stack, Last in First out.
    D <- C <- B <- A
